Sticky Notes and Whiteboard web-app

Controls are on the top of the window. Top left we have: draw, clear, new note buttons and a "Note:" textfield.

When we click draw we can begin drawing and we will notice the draw button has now changed to erase. Clicking erase will allow erasing of any drawing and change button to dragging. Dragging allows the user to drag any notes or images placed on the window.

Clicking clear will remove everything from the screen.

Clicking new note will add a new note to the screen that will grab the text from the text field under "Note:" to be placed on it. When clicking or dragging a note while the drag button has been selected, two additional buttons will appear at the top: change color and delete. Delete will delete the last clicked note and change color will change its color.

If the drag button hasn't been selected, users will not see the delete and change color buttons but instead a slider to which they can set their brush size for drawing or erasing.

At the bottom left we have an image url upload field. Placing a url of an image and then hitting submit will upload that image to the canvas. Images work like notes, they can be dragged however they can't be deleted or color changed. Only way to remove images is to use the clear button
